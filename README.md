## ReAct Character Counter Agent

ReAct Agent from scratch capable of counting the number of 'r's in 'strawberry' :grin:. 

Tool-calling ReAct Agent is [here](./react-agent/agent_count_chars.py).
* ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) architecture with specialized tool(s).
* Enable the LLM to reason about when to use external tools vs. when to answer directly (via iterative reasoning).
* JSON-Based Tool Calling: Clean interface for tool selection and invocation.
* Built on the OpenAI Python SDK with no external requirements
